# Benthic Foraminifera Pore Patterns in the Southeast Pacific

- Sebastián Garrido <sup>1,2</sup>

## Repository's Overview

This repository contains data and scripts related to the article "A species-specific approach to benthic foraminifera pore patterns as a paleoxygenation proxy in the Southeast Pacific" by Garrido et al. (in review). The research is focused on the use of pore patterns in benthic foraminifera as proxies for past bottom water dissolved oxygen (BWDO) levels in the Southeast Pacific (SEP), providing insights into changes in ocean oxygenation over the geological past. **First, here is an overview of our research to help you understand the goal and context of this repository.**

## Research's Abstract

Calcareous benthic foraminifera can develop pores in their test walls to facilitate gas exchanges (e.g., O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>) with the surrounding seawater. The patterns of these pores, such as porosity, pore density, and pore size, vary based on environmental factors, including BWDO. Some species react to lower BWDO levels by increasing test porosity, making them useful proxies for reconstructing past BWDO concentrations. This study validates this proxy in the Southeast Pacific (SEP) by comparing the pore patterns of six benthic foraminifera species with BWDO. Specimens dated recent (Holocene to modern) were collected from surface sediment samples along the SEP (12°–44°S) from 24 to 3,252 m water depth. Our findings reveal species-specific pore pattern responses to BWDO, with notable differences between *Cibicidoides* and *Planulina* species. *Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi* and its forma *plana* stand out for having the most robust results. These results support the use of benthic foraminifera pore patterns as reliable indicators for quantitatively reconstructing past BWDO levels, with an error range of ±5–20 µmol/kg.

## Research's Data and Methods

### Regional Setting and Samples
- The Southeast Pacific (SEP) features significant vertical, latitudinal, and longitudinal gradients in hydrological parameters (Silva et al., 2009, Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009).
- Our samples were collected from the Southeast Pacific between 12°S and 44°S along the continental margin of Chile and Peru, at depths ranging from 24 to 3,252 m (Figure 1).
- Sampling methods included Multicorer, box-corer, Petersen grab, and gravity core through the cruises (SONNE 156, SONNE 211, SONNE 161, Meteor 92, USNS Eltanin, BIAC072014)

### Specimen Selection and Imaging
- Specimens were wet-sieved to > 63 µm, oven-dried, and Rose Bengal stained.
- Selected specimens were cleaned, mounted on stubs, and imaged using a TM4000Plus HITACHI Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).

### Pore Patterns Measurements
- Pore patterns were measured using ImageJ software with custom Java macros.
- Measurements included porosity, pore density, and pore size.
- Data and codes to perform this part are in folder **"ImageJ-Scripts"**.

### Statistical Analysis
- Principal component analysis (PCA) and regression analysis were performed to explore the relationship between pore patterns and environmental parameters.
- Weighted Least Squares (WLS) regression was used to account for heteroscedasticity.

## Usage

### ImageJ Macros to Measure Pore Patterns 

1. **Open ImageJ**.
2. **Load the image** of the benthic foraminifera specimen you want to measure.
3. **What kind of measurement are you performing now?** This is important because you need to decide whether you will use the macros for penultimate and antepenultimate chambers (PAC) or for the entire spiral or umbilical side.
4. **Use the provided Java macros** to measure pore patterns on the images. You can load the macros by navigating to `Plugins > Macros > Run...` and selecting the appropriate `.ijm` file from the `ImageJ-Scripts` folder.
      - If you are performing PAC measurements, add the appropriate macro. Use `PoresSEP_75x50_x400.ijm` to measure the penultimate and antepenultimate chambers (PAC).
      - If you are measuring umbilical or spiral side measurements (all chambers included), check the magnification in the bottom left corner (60x, 80x, 100x, 120x, 150x, 180x, 200x, 250x, 300x). Use the other macros (`PoresSEP_x60.ijm`, `PoresSEP_x80.ijm`, etc.) to measure the entire umbilical and spiral sides at the specified magnifications.

### Data Analysis

1. **Run the Analysis Script**:
      - Navigate to the `DataAnalysis` folder.
      - Run the `PorePatternsSEP-Script.py` script to perform the statistical analysis and generate visualizations of pore patterns.
2. **Input Data**:
      - The script uses the `Dataset Pore Measurements Garrido et al..csv` file as input. Ensure this file is in the same directory as the script.
3. **Output**:
      - We recommend an environment similar to the one in `PorePatternsSEP-ScriptFiles.zip`. This folder also contains the Python script (`PorePatternsSEP-Script.py`). Moreover, you can find the same dataset (`Dataset Pore Measurements Garrido et al..csv`) in the folder `Datasets`. In that folder (`Datasets`), you can find two folders `Created datasets` and `Created Figures`, where the code will create secondary datasets and figures from the main analysis. Ensure the directories match in the Python code.
